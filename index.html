        <p id="p1">Its funny how hello is alway accompanied with goodbye, 
                Its funny how good memories can start to make you cry.
                Its funny how forever never really seems to last, 
                Its funny how much you'd lose if you forgot about your past.
                Its funny how 'friends' can just leave you when your down, 
                Its funny how when you need someone their never around.
                Its funny how people change and think they're so much better, 
                Its funny how many lies can be packed into one 'love letter'.
                Its funny how people forgive even though they cant forget, 
                Its funny how one night can contain so much regret.
                Its funny how ironic life turns out to be, 
                But the funniest part of all...
                Is that none of thats funny to me
