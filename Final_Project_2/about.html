    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>Welcome to Bio-Caam Industry. We named ourselves Bio-Caam because of our names:Miles Shaw, Claudia Ayala, Alanna Le, and Alfredo Alcala;  we used our first name initial to create our industry. We are from all over the Bay: Richmond, Hayward,  East Oakland, and Bay Point. Our interest consist of music, dance, sports, community service, running, hiking, writing, and watching memes. We all met due to SMASH and it has changed our lives. We decided to make our project on coral reefs because they are rapidly dying and we need to change that. Not only are they dying due to global warming which causes temperatures to increase, making the ocean acidic, and sea levels to rise, but suncreen and plastic are a huge part of it. Continue exploring and find ways to join our non-profit to better the world. </p>
