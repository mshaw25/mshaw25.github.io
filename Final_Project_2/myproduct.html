        <p id="p3">THESE ARE OUR PRODUCTS</p>
        <p id="p2">First we have our natural sunscreen that is free from oxybenzone so we can protect our coral reefs. Not only is it chemical free, but it is free from animal cruelty. We have them in glass containers so you can reuse them for other purposes or refill them again with our sunscreen. Now thats just the beginning; we will also be selling eco-friendly clothing. Our non-profit will be taking plastic from oceans and beaches to reduce the amount of plastic admitted to the marine life and converting it to affordable clothing for many to use. Check our products out and help our cause by purchasing some of your own! The T-Shirts below will be made of 80% recycled plastic and the Phone Case is 100% recylced plastic!!!
